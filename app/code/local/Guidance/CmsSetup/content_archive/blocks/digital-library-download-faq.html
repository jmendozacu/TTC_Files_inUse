    <div class="question-block">What systems or devices can I download to?</div>
    <div class="answer-block">
        The Great Courses can be played on almost any device that has a media player.
        Currently, you cannot download directly to most devices such as iPad or iPhone,
        but you can copy your course lectures to your computer, then to your device. Some
        steps to follow to do this:
    </div>
    <ul class="answers-list">
        <li>Download your lectures to a computer</li>
        <li>Import your files into your media player, such as iTunes. You may have to open each file separately to import properly.</li>
        <li>Sync your device (for example, iPad, iPhone or tablet) with your computer as you normally would.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Downloading Files</h2>

    <div class="question-block">How do I download my courses?</div>

        After the Course Downloader is installed on your computer, the courses you have purchased will be available in My Downloads in the My Account section of our site.
        If you do not see your downloadable courses, then sign out, close your browser and sign back in.
    </div>

    <div class="question-block">How long does it take to download?</div>
    <div class="answer-block">
        On average, using a broadband connection, each lecture takes approximately 10-15 minutes to download.
        We recommend downloading no more than three lectures at a time.

    <ul class="answers-list">

            <strong>PC users:</strong><br>
            To clear your cache, go to your start menu for your operating system.

            Select preferences, then the clear button in the download cache folder.
        </li>
    </ul>

        See "What media formats are available?" in this section.
    </div>

    <div class="question-block">How do I find my downloads on my computer?</div>
    <div class="answer-block">
        When you start the download, you will be prompted to select the folder to which you'd like to save your courses.
        We recommend creating a folder on your desktop called "The Great Courses".
        You can create subfolders in this folder to help you organize your courses (see topic under Saving and Organizing Files).
        If you can't find your courses, then you can search your computer for the course number or check where downloaded files typically go.
        Some possible locations are:
    </div>

    <ul class="answers-list">
        <li>On a PC: C:\..[username]\My Documents\Downloads</li>
        <li>On a Mac: ...[username]\ Downloads. You can check this by going to your browser and choosing Preferences. In the General tab, look at the setting "Save Downloaded Files To".</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="question-block">How do I download my course guidebooks?</div>
    <div class="answer-block">
        Your course guidebooks will be available in .pdf format in My Downloads in the My Account section of our site.
        You will need Adobe Acrobat Reader to view these files. You can download a free copy from Adobe's site.
