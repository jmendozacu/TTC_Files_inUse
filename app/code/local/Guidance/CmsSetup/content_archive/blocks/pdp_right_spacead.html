        <dt>Our Story</dt>
        <dd>
            It all started with a Harvard Law student…
            <div class="why-tgc-description no-display">
                <p>Thomas M. Rollins, the founder of The Great Courses, was a law student at Harvard University facing an important exam on the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence ­—an exam for which he wasn’t prepared.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Dreading the notoriously boring subject but knowing his success depended on understanding the material, Rollins obtained videotapes of 10 lectures by a professor from another school who was noted for being insightful, thorough, and witty.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Rollins played the videotaped lectures nearly nonstop, and a few days later he got an “A” on his exam. Rollins never forgot the unique power of recorded lectures by a great teacher, the way that a bright mind could ignite a passion for lifelong learning. </p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1990, he founded The Great Courses to share that unforgettable experience with the rest of the world.</p>

        <dt>Rave Reviews from Our Customers</dt>

            Our courses score an average of 4.4 out of 5 stars.
            <div class="why-tgc-description no-display">
                <p>With more than 20,000 customer reviews on our website, our courses score an average of 4.4 out of 5 stars.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Why are these scores and ratings so high? It’s simple: Because we work closely with our customers and subject-matter experts to design the Great Courses. Here’s how we do it:</p>
                <br>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>
                        <p>You choose the lecturer. We begin with the top 1% of professors and experts in America. In the end, only 1 in 5,000 meets the standards set by our customers, who vote on every professor before a course is made.</p>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>You choose the courses.  We interview hundreds of thousands of customers to find out what subjects they want to learn and how they want courses to be made.</p>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The lecturers carefully prepare each course. Months of preparation ensure that a course is crafted to be an engaging audio and video experience. Our professors and experts outline and prepare each lecture and write the extensive Course Guidebook.</p>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When you finish one of our courses, we invite you to complete a ballot to tell us what you think. We read every response, and we sincerely appreciate your feedback.</p>
