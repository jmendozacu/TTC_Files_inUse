<div class="tooltip-body-text">
<p><strong>Your Personal Information and Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>How we use or disclose your name, address, and e-mail address</strong></p>
<p>We use your name and address to send you course materials you order, our catalogs, and newsletters.</p>
<p>Here's what we do with your e-mail address:</p>
<p>Send you order confirmations. You should receive via e-mail an order confirmation within moments of placing your order.</p>
<p>Send you course starter materials. Designed to supplement your learning experience, you'll receive course starter materials for every course you purchase. These materials include the professor's summary of the course, links to recommended websites, and recommended readings.</p>
<p>Send you free articles. Occasionally, you'll receive interesting and compelling articles of interest on the subjects covered by our courses.</p>
<p>Collect your feedback on courses and professors. You'll receive e-mail surveys to vote for the Great Courses you want us to make, to rate the quality of Great Courses you've purchased, to tell us what improvements to make to The Great Courses and our services, and to tell us which professors we should choose to make the next Great Course.</p>
<p>Notify you of special sale offers. You'll receive e-mails notifying you when courses featured in our print catalogs and newsletters go on sale. These e-mails also make ordering extremely simple—if you see courses that interest you, simply click on the links in the e-mail to find out more.</p>
<p>With regard to name and postal address only, from time to time, we may make our mailing list available to carefully screened companies. If you prefer we don’t share your name and postal address, please call our Customer Care team at 1-800-832-2412 or write to us at The Great Courses, 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 500, Chantilly, VA, 20151-2299. </p>
<p>(However, because this reflects a change in practice, the new policy applies only to the names and postal addresses of new customers added to our mailing list after October 1, 2013.)</p>
<p>How we protect your billing information</p>
<p>When you order from us online, we protect your information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. We are secured by Comodo, the leading provider of SSL encryption keys. SSL encryption electronically masks any information you send us. With this state-of-the-art system, you can enter your credit card number and delivery and billing information safely. The encryption process protects the information by scrambling it before it is sent to us.</p>
<p>You can verify our compliance at any time by clicking on the Comodo logo located on our Shopping Cart page or any page in the checkout process.</p>
<p>If you feel uncomfortable buying through our site, we'd be delighted to take your orders via:</p>
