Any description of how Streaming Service works should not be considered a representation or obligation with respect to how the service will always work. We are constantly making adjustments to Streaming Service and often these adjustments are not completely captured within these Terms and Conditions.</p>
    <h2><em>(a) Availability of Streaming Service:</em></h2>
    <p>The availability of Streaming Service will change from time to time, and from country to country. The quality of Streaming Services may vary from computer to computer, and device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your internet connection. We will stream a small amount of data to your device as a buffer each time you start Streaming Service. Frequently starting and stopping Streaming Service will result in a minor increase to the amount of data the Company streams to you per hour. You are responsible for ensuring that you have internet access and for all internet access charges. Please check with your internet provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges. The Company makes no representations or warranties about the quality of Streaming Service. <br /> Streaming Service may be unavailable to you from time to time in connection with maintenance or for other technical or non-technical reasons, and, as a result, without prior notice to you, some or all Products or Services ordinarily available via Streaming Service may cease to be available.</p>
    <h2><em>(b) Initiation of Streaming Service:</em></h2>
    <p>The amount of time it takes to initiate Streaming Service on a device will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time, the particular Product or Service you have selected and the configuration of your device. In addition, you must be connected to the internet throughout the period in which you are accessing Streaming Service.</p>
    <h2><em>(c) Geographic Limitations: </em></h2>
    <p>You may access Streaming Service only in geographic locations where we offer Streaming Service. In addition, the content that may be available to watch may vary by geographic location.</p>

WE DO NOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ITS CONTINUING COMPATIBILITY WITH OUR SERVICE.

Please review our Frequently Asked Questions pages on our Site, as relevant, before ordering Products and Services from us.<br /> <strong>(ii) Restrictions on Age of Purchaser</strong><br /> You must be 18 years of age or older to place an order on our Site. In certain jurisdictions, the age of majority may be older than 18, in which case you must satisfy that age in order to become a member.

    <h2><em>(b) Product Orders for Shipment</em></h2>
    <p>When you place an order to purchase a Product from our Site, we will send you a confirmatory email that will contain details of the Product(s) you have ordered along with any delivery charges. <br /> You must check that the details in the confirmatory email are correct as soon as possible and should print out and keep a copy of it for your records.<br /> Your order will represent an offer to us to purchase the relevant Product(s) which will be accepted by us when we dispatch the Product(s) ordered from our headquarters in Virginia, USA, to you.<br /> We will confirm that the Product(s) (other than downloads and Streaming Service) have been dispatched to you by sending you an e-mail confirmation (a &ldquo;Shipping Confirmation&rdquo;). This Shipping Confirmation will be evidence that we dispatched the Product(s) to you, and that the contract between us (the &ldquo;Contract&rdquo;) has been formed. The Contract shall be deemed to include these Terms and Conditions.<br /> In the event that we are unable to fulfill your total order in one shipment (for example if one of the Products you have ordered are out of stock), any Product(s) on the same order which we have not confirmed in the Shipping Confirmation to have been dispatched will not form part of that Contract. We will not be obliged to supply any such Product(s) which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Product(s) has been confirmed in a separate Shipping Confirmation.</p>
    <h2><em>(c) Orders for Digital Download or Streaming Service</em></h2>
    <p>When you place an order to purchase any downloadable Products or Services, we will send you a confirmatory email that will contain details of what you have ordered, any delivery charges, as well as details regarding how you can download them.

    <h2><em>(d) Import Duty</em></h2>
    <p>Orders may be subject to import duties and taxes which are levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order, and please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions Page of our Site for further information.<br /> Please also note that it is your responsibility to understand and comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the products are destined. We will not be liable for any breach by you of any such laws.</p>
    <h2><em>(e) Risk and Title</em></h2>
    <p>The risk of loss or damage to Product(s) passes to you on delivery of the Product(s).<br /> Ownership of the Product(s) will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the Product(s), including postage and packing charges.</p>
    <h2><em>(f) Pricing</em></h2>
    <p>The price of any Product(s) will be as quoted on our Site from time to time, except in cases of obvious error.<br /> Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders for which we have already sent you a Shipping Confirmation (or confirmation email in relation to downloads).<br /> Our Site contains a large number of Products and Services and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products and Services listed on our Site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch and distribution procedures so that, where a Product&rsquo;s or Service&rsquo;s correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching or distributing such Product or Service to you. If a Product&rsquo;s correct price is higher than the price stated on our Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection. In such circumstances, we are under no obligation to provide the Product or Service to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you a Shipping Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognized by you as incorrect pricing.</p>
    <h2><em>(g) Payment</em></h2>
    <p>Payment for all Products and Services must be by credit or debit card. We accept payment with American Express, Visa, MasterCard and Discover. We will not charge your credit or debit card until we dispatch your order.</p>
