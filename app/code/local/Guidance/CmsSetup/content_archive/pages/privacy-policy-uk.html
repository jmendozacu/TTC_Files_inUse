Any and all personal/billing information we collect from you will be processed in accordance with both this privacy policy and the Data Protection Act 1998. Any personal data provided to, or collected by, The Great Courses, will be controlled by The Teaching Company Sales Company, LLC [who will be the data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998].</p>
