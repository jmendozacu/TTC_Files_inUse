            <p>Shortly after joining The Great Courses in 2012 as Executive Vice President of Ecommerce, Scott Ableman
                was named as the company's first-ever Chief Marketing Officer. In this expansive role, he leads the
                company's investments in the online, mobile, and digital experience.</p>
            <p>Scott has extensive experience in ecommerce, brand marketing, product development, and customer
                experience. He previously served as Chief Marketing Officer at Simplexity, where he built the
                Wirefly.com brand and helped the company become the Internet's leading retailer of cell phones and
                wireless services.</p>
            <p>As Chief Marketing Officer at Winstar Communications, Scott built a nationwide marketing organization
                to offer telecommunications and Internet services to small businesses. He also held several management
                positions in consumer marketing and product development at Network Solutions and MCI Communications.</p>
            <p>Scott earned his M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and his
                bachelor's degree in Consumer Behavior from the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>In his spare time, Scott enjoys photography, expedition travel, and rooting for the Washington
                Nationals. His ever-expanding list of favorite Great Courses includes Foundations of Western
                Civilization, Biology and Human Behavior, Fundamentals of Photography, and The Art of Critical
                Decision Making. He lives in McLean, VA, with his wife and two children.</p>
