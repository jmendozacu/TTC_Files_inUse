                    <p>Your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed! If a course is ever less than completely satisfying, you may exchange it for another of equal value at any time. You may also return any course, within one year of initial purchase, for a full refund. And, if a disc ever breaks, warps, or gets damaged, we’ll replace it as long as the course is in production, free.</p>
                    <p>Most publishers do not guarantee that you will be satisfied with their books or recordings. But we do. We guarantee your satisfaction for a lifetime because we want you to be our customer for a lifetime of learning.</p>
                    <p>This guarantee not only protects your investment in learning, it also compels us to produce great courses; otherwise, we’d go out of business. We call our lectures “The Great Courses,” and if we don’t deliver great courses, we don’t deserve the money.</p>
