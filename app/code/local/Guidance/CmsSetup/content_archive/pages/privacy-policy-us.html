                    <li><h6>Collect your feedback on courses and professors.</h6> You'll receive e-mail surveys to vote for the Great Courses you want us to make, to rate the quality of Great Courses you've purchased, to tell us what improvements to make to The Great Courses and our services, and to tell us which professors we should choose to make the next Great Course.</li>
                    <li><h6>Notify you of special sale offers.</h6> You'll receive e-mails notifying you when courses featured in our print catalogs and newsletters go on sale.

                <p>With regard to name and postal address only, from time to time, we may make our mailing list available to carefully screened companies.
