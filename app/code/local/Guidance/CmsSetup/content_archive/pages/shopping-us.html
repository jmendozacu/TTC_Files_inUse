                <h3>About Our Sales</h3>
                <p>Every Great Course goes on sale at least once a year at up to 70% off its standard price. This revolving sales approach allows you to get both great value and great service. Here's how: Producing large quantities of only the Great Courses currently on sale keeps our manufacturing and inventory costs down.</p>
                <p>More important: We get to pass these savings on to you. This approach also enables us to fill your order immediately: 99% of all orders placed by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time ship that same day.</p>
                <p>To find out which courses are currently on sale, please check our catalogs, emails, newsletters, or the Special Sale section on our website.</p>

                <h3>Coupon and Priority Codes</h3>
                <p>Some advertised prices require a 5-digit priority code or coupon code to receive the advertised price. These codes can be entered when you are ready to checkout at the shopping cart page.</p>
                <p>On a Great Courses catalog, the code is on the back of your catalog, near your address<br /> On a Great Courses email offer, the code can be found at the bottom of the email<br /> On an advertisement, the code is near the advertised price of the product</p>
                <h6>What if the price doesn&rsquo;t match the advertisement?</h6>
                <p><br /> If the advertised offer has not expired, simply add the course(s) to your cart, and enter your priority code or coupon code in the provided spaces. This will activate the prices you saw in the associated advertisement or catalog.</p>
                <h6>How do I use multiple coupons?</h6>
                <p><br /> Coupon offers are limited to one per customer and cannot be combined.</p>
