                <p>We provide streaming Products and Services and non-streaming digital downloads over the internet to certain devices (streaming and non-streaming digital downloads are hereinafter collectively referred to as &ldquo;Streaming Service&rdquo;). Currently, Streaming Service is only available on computers and certain iPad&Acirc;&reg; devices. We reserve the right in our sole and absolute discretion to make changes from time to time and without notice in how we operate Streaming Service. Any description of how Streaming Service works should not be considered a representation or obligation with respect to how the service will always work.

We will stream a small amount of data to your device as a buffer each time you start Streaming Service. Frequently starting and stopping Streaming Service will result in a minor increase to the amount of data the Company streams to you per hour.

                <h4>(b) Initiation of Streaming Service:</h4>

                <h4>(b) Product Orders for Shipment</h4>
                <p>When you place an order to purchase a Product from our Site, we will send you a confirmatory email that will contain details of the Product(s) you have ordered along with any delivery charges.</p>
                <p>You must check that the details in the confirmatory email are correct as soon as possible and should print out and keep a copy of it for your records.</p>
                <p>Your order will represent an offer to us to purchase the relevant Product(s) which will be accepted by us when we dispatch the Product(s) ordered from our headquarters in Virginia, USA, to you.</p>
                <p>We will confirm that the Product(s) (other than downloads and Streaming Service) have been dispatched to you by sending you an e-mail confirmation (a &ldquo;Shipping Confirmation&rdquo;). This Shipping Confirmation will be evidence that we dispatched the Product(s) to you, and that the contract between us (the &ldquo;Contract&rdquo;) has been formed. The Contract shall be deemed to include these Terms and Conditions.</p>
                <p>In the event that we are unable to fulfill your total order in one shipment (for example if one of the Products you have ordered are out of stock), any Product(s) on the same order which we have not confirmed in the Shipping Confirmation to have been dispatched will not form part of that Contract. We will not be obliged to supply any such Product(s) which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Product(s) has been confirmed in a separate Shipping Confirmation.</p>
                <h4>(c) Orders for Digital Download or Streaming Service</h4>
                <p>When you place an order to purchase any downloadable Products or Services, we will send you a confirmatory email that will contain details of what you have ordered, any delivery charges, as well as details regarding how you can download them. When you are purchasing a downloadable or streaming Product or Service, the Contract between us relating to such downloads or streaming Products or Services will only be formed once we make those Products and Services available for you to download from our servers.</p>
                <h4>(d) Import Duty</h4>
                <p>Orders may be subject to import duties and taxes which are levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order, and please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions Page of our Site for further information.</p>
                <p>Please also note that it is your responsibility to understand and comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the products are destined. We will not be liable for any breach by you of any such laws.</p>
                <h4>(e) Risk and Title</h4>
                <p>The risk of loss or damage to Product(s) passes to you on delivery of the Product(s).<br /> Ownership of the Product(s) will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the Product(s), including postage and packing charges.</p>
                <h4>(f) Pricing</h4>
                <p>The price of any Product(s) will be as quoted on our Site from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders for which we have already sent you a Shipping Confirmation (or confirmation email in relation to downloads).<br /><br /> Our Site contains a large number of Products and Services and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products and Services listed on our Site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch and distribution procedures so that, where a Product&rsquo;s or Service&rsquo;s correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching or distributing such Product or Service to you. If a Product&rsquo;s correct price is higher than the price stated on our Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection. In such circumstances, we are under no obligation to provide the Product or Service to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you a Shipping Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognized by you as incorrect pricing.</p>
                <h4>(g) Payment</h4>
                <p>Payment for all Products and Services must be by credit or debit card. We accept payment with American Express, Visa, MasterCard and Discover. We will not charge your credit or debit card until we dispatch your order.</p>
