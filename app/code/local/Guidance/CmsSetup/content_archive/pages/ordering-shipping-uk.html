                <p>When you order either by phone or online, we fulfill your order immediately. Digital purchases are available to begin streaming instantly, and 99% of all CD or DVD orders placed by 7pm GBT go out the same day. Shipments are via DHL GlobalMail. Allow 5-7 days for delivery to the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>We charge a flat shipping, processing, and guarantee fee based on your total order. (That means when courses are on sale, you get more than twice as much material for the same rate!)</p>
                <p>We do not make a profit on this fee. We charge only what&rsquo;s necessary to cover the processing of credit cards and checks, shipping your courses via Priority Mail or FedEx Smartpost, and direct labor, supplies, and warehousing costs.</p>
