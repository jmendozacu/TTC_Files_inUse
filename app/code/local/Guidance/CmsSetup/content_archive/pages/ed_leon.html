            <p>Since coming aboard as Senior Vice President of Product Development in 2009, Ed Leon has helped
                transform The Great Courses brand into a category-leading media product. In this role, he supervises
                all stages of course development and production, steering The Great Courses toward products that are
                ever more intellectually comprehensive, visually captivating, and broadly reaching.</p>
            <p>Named Chief Brand Officer in 2013, Ed has taken on the additional responsibility of driving the creative
                vision of The Great Courses through its multiple marketing touch points that include catalogs, The
                Great Courses website, and online promotions, while continuing to expand the scope and breadth of the
                Product Development division.</p>
            <p>In his earlier roles as creator and producer of broadcast and cable programming, Ed delivered thousands
                of hours of signature programs for some of the biggest companies in the media business, including NBC,
                Fox, ABC, MTV, Disney, CBS, Time Warner, Sony, and Viacom. He was a founding executive of the Nuvo
                cable TV channel, earned multiple Emmy nominations as Senior Producer of Dr. Phil, and won numerous
                honors, including the Emmy and Golden Mike for news excellence, multiple marketing Promax Awards, and
                Cable Ace Awards for producing and directing documentaries. Ed is a member of the Writer's Guild of
                America and the Director's Guild of America. He earned his bachelor's degree in Communication Arts
                from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>You will see and hear Ed as the presenter in the preview videos that accompany most courses on the
                website and as the host of The Torch: The Great Courses Podcast, where he interviews our great
                professors. When he's not in a creative meeting or in the studio, he enjoys riding his motorcycle
                along the verdant roadways of northern Virginia.</p>
