            <p>Having grown up in Virginia, Shana is happy to still call it home (go Redskins!). Outside of work, she
                enjoys going on beach trips with her husband and daughter, improving her tennis skills, and trying out
                her latest recipe find on Pinterest. Her favorite Great Courses are Understanding the Brain and Stress
                and Your Body.</p>
