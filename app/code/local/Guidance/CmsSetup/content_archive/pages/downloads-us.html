                <h3>Downloads and Streaming</h3>
                <p>There&rsquo;s no need to wait for your courses to arrive in the mail. You can start discovering new insights in just minutes on your personal computer, laptop, smart phone, or iPad.</p>
                <p>Streaming is the easiest way to view or listen to your courses. All you need is a computer, laptop or mobile device with a high speed internet connection. Just visit My Digital Library, choose the lecture you want to enjoy next, and it will start playing.</p>
                <p>When you are on the go or do not have access to a high speed internet connection, your Digital Library gives you the option to download lectures to your favorite device for listening later. Downloading is easiest and fastest for audio courses. Video files are large and take up a lot of storage space on your device, so we recommend downloading no more than a few video lectures at a time.</p>
                <p>If you have trouble accessing your digital library, check out our Frequently Asked Questions for downloads or streaming.</p>
                <p class="faq-p"><span class="question_span"><h6 class="question">Q:</h6>What is the difference between downloading and streaming?</span><br /> <span><h6 class="answer">A:</h6>When you download a lecture, you save it to your computer. It will take up disk space, but you will be able to access the lecture offline. When you stream via our website or apps, you are not saving anything to your computer. The lecture is playing directly from the website, so it requires an internet connection.</span></p>
                <p class="faq-p"><span class="question_span"><h6 class="question">Q:</h6>I&rsquo;m still confused. Can you explain it another way?</span><br /> <span><h6 class="answer">A:</h6>Sure! Think of streaming like the radio. When you turn on your radio, you can listen to a broadcast. Downloading is like making a cassette tape of your favorite radio program so you can listen to it again later.</span></p>
                <p class="faq-p"><span class="question_span"><h6 class="question">Q:</h6>Is downloading the best way for me to enjoy my courses?</span> <br /> <h6 class="answer">A:</h6> Downloading is for you if:</p>

                <p class="faq-p"><span class="question_span"><h6 class="question">Q:</h6>What should I do before downloading courses?</span><br /> <span><h6 class="answer">A:</h6>Before downloading courses, make sure you have enough free space on your hard drive. We recommend making a new folder titled The Great Courses and downloading your lectures to that folder so they are all in one place.</span></p>
