                <h3>Returns &amp; Exchanges</h3>
                <p>For your convenience, every shipment includes a return form on the back of your invoice. If you do not have your invoice, you may print the form here. Please send this form back with your purchase including all original discs, boxes, and guide books. We will issue an exchange, a refund check, or a refund to your credit card within 4-5 weeks of receiving your return.</p>
                <p>For exchanges, you may choose any course of equal or lower value. Please write the course number of the new course you are requesting on the form, or in a separate note in the box if the form is not available. When estimating the value of your exchange, please remember to include shipping and processing and original coupon value, if used.</p>
                <p>Please return courses to:</p>

                <h3>Replacements</h3>
                <p>If a disc ever breaks, warps, or gets damaged, The Great Courses will replace it as long as the course is in print, absolutely free. We do not require you to return broken, warped, or damaged discs.</p>

                <h3>The Great Courses Lifetime Guarantee</h3>
                <p>Your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed! If a course is ever less than completely satisfying, you may exchange it for another of equal value at any time. You may also return any course, within one year of initial purchase, for a full refund. And, if a disc ever breaks, warps, or gets damaged, we&rsquo;ll replace it as long as the course is in production, free.</p>
                <p>Most publishers do not guarantee that you will be satisfied with their books or recordings. But we do. We guarantee your satisfaction for a lifetime because we want you to be our customer for a lifetime of learning.</p>
                <p>This guarantee not only protects your investment in learning, it also compels us to produce great courses; otherwise, we&rsquo;d go out of business. We call our lectures &ldquo;The Great Courses,&rdquo; and if we don&rsquo;t deliver great courses, we don&rsquo;t deserve the money.</p>
