                    <p class="quote">Not since my own dissertation defense had I felt “tested” in the way I was by The Great Courses test lectures. That they were willing to devote such time, money, and resources to vetting lecturers made clear the company’s commitment to producing the highest quality courses. The emphasis on quality was just as clear in every later stage of production, from the editorial feedback to the preparation of the visual aids and the meticulous way in which the taping was done, with every syllable being checked and double checked, and every “fix” reviewed two or three times.</p>

                    <p class="quote">Turning a college classroom course into a Great Course is an awesome experience. Nothing hones a course better than having to shape it into a disciplined experience with the advice and guidance of the Great Courses experts. The course becomes clearer.  The experience vastly improves your teaching when you carry it back to the classroom and make all your classroom courses better.</p>
